<p align="center">A Financial Advisor Powered by Digital Twins of Warren Buffett & Ray Dalio
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>FinTwin Advisor is an AI-powered platform that brings financial insights to users by simulating conversations with legendary financial figures like Warren Buffett and Ray Dalio. Users can interact with their "digital twins," receiving personalized investment advice, strategic insights, and much more.

This project demonstrates the power of decentralized AI, using agents that mimic real-world experts. The system leverages clusters of agents to simulate both collaboration and contrasting viewpoints from financial icons, giving users a unique experience.</p>

## Features
- 🧑‍💼 Choose Your Advisor: Chat with the "digital twin" of either Warren Buffett or Ray Dalio, each providing unique perspectives on financial strategies.
  
- 💬 Natural Language Interaction: Seamlessly interact with advisors via a conversational interface that mimics real-world advice.
  
- 🧠 AI-Powered Insights: The responses are generated using advanced Llama2-based AI agents that learn and adapt over time.
- 🔄 Decentralized AI Clustering: Use multiple agent clusters to enhance decision-making through a dynamic network of nodes.

## How It Works
FinTwin Advisor utilizes the GaiaNet public node to handle requests and provide responses from the digital twin agents. Users can select their preferred advisor and ask questions on various topics related to finance, investment, and wealth management. The system sends the user's queries to the appropriate AI agent, and responses are returned in real-time.

## Workflow
- User selects either Warren Buffett or Ray Dalio as their advisor.

- User asks a question, such as “What is your advice on long-term investing?”

- The system routes the question to the selected advisor's AI twin, generating personalized advice based on the persona of that financial expert.

- The user receives the AI-generated financial insights.
